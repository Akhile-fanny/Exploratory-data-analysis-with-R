# Exploratory-data-analysis-with-R

I used R programming language to explore the popular gapminder dataset.

It offers information from 1952 to 2007 on the population, life expectancy, and GDP of various nations throughout the world.Â 
I used the mainly dplyr to explore the data and created plots using ggplot.
